WEBVTT 1 00:00:13.056 --> 00:00:19.200 Hi everyone! This is Professor Bassem Allam. I am a marine biologist at Stony Brook University, and 2 00:00:19.456 --> 00:00:25.600 I study shellfish physiology and health! As part of my job, I am in charge of monitoring the health 3 00:00:25.856 --> 00:00:32.000 of shellfish species in New York State waters. So today, I am on a fishing boat in 4 00:00:32.256 --> 00:00:38.400 Long Island Sound, and I am collecting oysters for our lab. Let's go back to the campus! 5 00:00:38.656 --> 00:00:44.800 Welcome to the lab! In this session, you will get familiar with oyster 6 00:00:45.056 --> 00:00:51.200 external and internal anatomy, and you will receive a hands-on experience of some of the diagnostic 7 00:00:51.456 --> 00:00:57.600 tools we use to identify pests and parasites affecting these animals! 8 00:00:57.856 --> 00:01:02.976 While I will be dissecting, my colleague Nora will be narrating the procedure. 9 00:01:03.488 --> 00:01:07.072 Let's start with some tools you will be using during this procedure 10 00:01:07.328 --> 00:01:12.192 A syringe and needle, a clam shucking knife, scissors, tweezers, and a scalpel. 11 00:01:12.704 --> 00:01:16.544 This is the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica 12 00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.664 One of the most important species of bivalve along the coast of the US, 13 00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.456 including New York State 14 00:01:24.736 --> 00:01:30.880 As you can see, the two shells are not identical. While the bottom or "left" 15 00:01:31.136 --> 00:01:33.184 shell of the oyster is curved, 16 00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.768 the top or "right" shell is flat. 17 00:01:37.792 --> 00:01:43.936 The oyster has a narrow hinged end, and a wide fluted end. The hinge is the area 18 00:01:44.192 --> 00:01:46.496 where the two shells are connected. 19 00:01:46.752 --> 00:01:52.896 The right side of the right shell is called the interior end, while the left side 20 00:01:53.152 --> 00:01:55.968 is called the posterior end. 21 00:01:58.784 --> 00:02:04.928 The mouth is located at the interior end of the animal, while the rectum is located at the 22 00:02:05.184 --> 00:02:06.208 posterior end. 23 00:02:06.976 --> 00:02:13.120 Looking at the shell, it is possible to see artifacts, including worm tubes attached to the shell. 24 00:02:13.888 --> 00:02:19.520 The tubes may contain polychaete worms such as Polydorus species. 25 00:02:20.032 --> 00:02:26.176 In addition, it is not rare to observe small holes left by sponges that colonized the shell. 26 00:02:28.992 --> 00:02:35.136 To open or "shuck" the oyster, we will be using the hinge entering shucking method. 27 00:02:35.392 --> 00:02:37.440 Let's first act what to do: 28 00:02:37.696 --> 00:02:42.816 Position the oyster cupped side down, with the hinge facing you. 29 00:02:43.072 --> 00:02:48.704 Insert the tip of the oyster knife between the two shells, where they are joined at the hinge. 30 00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.032 The curved tip must be oriented to the top. 31 00:02:54.336 --> 00:03:00.480 Move the blade forward between the flat right shell, and cut the adductor muscle where 32 00:03:00.736 --> 00:03:06.112 it joins the right shell. When the muscle has been incised, the top shell will budge. 33 00:03:07.648 --> 00:03:11.744 Now let's place the oyster on a flat surface, and shuck it. 34 00:03:12.256 --> 00:03:16.608 Use a twisting motion to gently pry the shells slightly apart. 35 00:03:18.144 --> 00:03:24.288 Move the blade along the flat shell, and cut the adductor muscle. Be sure to keep the blade 36 00:03:24.544 --> 00:03:30.688 pressed up against the inner top surface of the right shell. Otherwise, you'll risk cutting the oyster meat itself. 37 00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.600 Now you can gently pry the top shell away from the bottom shell with the knife blade. 38 00:03:37.856 --> 00:03:44.000 Pull the right shell completely off. Notice the position of the adductor muscle scar on 39 00:03:44.256 --> 00:03:45.792 the inside of the right shell. 40 00:03:47.584 --> 00:03:53.728 Let's identify the different organs of the oyster. The first tissue we can see is the mantle. 41 00:03:53.984 --> 00:03:59.616 The mantle produces the shell and covers the internal organs. 42 00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:06.016 It's made of two fleshy folds of tissues always in contact with the shells, but not attached to them. 43 00:04:06.528 --> 00:04:12.672 Then, at the posterior region of the oyster, we can identify a large organ 44 00:04:12.928 --> 00:04:19.071 called the adductor muscle. It's made of two parts, one large and peachy, and the other 45 00:04:19.327 --> 00:04:24.959 smaller and whiteish. The adductor muscle functions to close the oyster shell. 46 00:04:26.495 --> 00:04:31.359 Close to the adductor muscle, we can observe the pericardial cavity. 47 00:04:31.615 --> 00:04:35.967 This cavity is filled with blood called hemolymph, and contains the heart. 48 Let's dissect the membrane, so we can observe the heart of the animal beating. 49 00:04:57.215 --> 00:05:03.359 To collect the hemolymph and observe the blood cells, you will need a 1 mL syringe, and a 50 00:05:03.615 --> 00:05:04.639 22 gauge needle. 51 00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:12.063 For educational purposes, we are going to collect the hemolymph directly by punching a hole 52 00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:14.111 into the pericardial cavity. 53 00:05:16.415 --> 00:05:19.999 We can then observe the hemocytes using a microscope. 54 00:05:20.767 --> 00:05:26.911 This short video shows you how an oyster's hemocytes phagocytocize plastic beads added 55 00:05:27.167 --> 00:05:28.191 to the preparation. 56 00:05:28.447 --> 00:05:32.031 These cells play an important role in oyster defense. 57 00:05:33.055 --> 00:05:35.871 Let's continue describing oyster anatomy. 58 00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:38.687 Below the mantle we can observe the gills. 59 00:05:38.943 --> 00:05:44.831 The gills are the largest organ in the oyster's body, and consist of 4 folds of tissue. 60 00:05:49.183 --> 00:05:55.327 Along with the mantle, it is the chief organ of respiration. They create water currents, 61 00:05:55.583 --> 00:06:01.727 collect and sort food particles, and move food particles to the labial palps for further sorting. 62 00:06:04.287 --> 00:06:10.431 they also serve to separate masses of eggs released from the ovary during spawning into 63 00:06:10.687 --> 00:06:13.759 individual ova for efficient fertilization. 64 00:06:15.295 --> 00:06:19.135 Close to the gill, we can observe the labial palps. 65 00:06:19.391 --> 00:06:25.535 They consist of two pairs of large, soft flabs that have a roughly triangular shape. 66 00:06:26.303 --> 00:06:32.447 These specialized organs are known to control the total amount of food ingested, but also sort food 67 00:06:32.703 --> 00:06:33.983 before ingestion. 68 00:06:34.239 --> 00:06:40.383 Unwanted material are rejected as pseudofeces. The mouth is located between the palps. 69 00:06:42.943 --> 00:06:48.063 This area corresponds to the visceral mass, including the stomach. 70 00:06:50.111 --> 00:06:56.255 At the end of the digestive tract at the posterior side of the animal, we can observe the rectum, 71 00:06:56.511 --> 00:07:00.863 along the adductor muscle, and at the extremity, the anus. 72 00:07:01.119 --> 00:07:07.263 In order to determine if the oysters are infected with the parasite Perkinsus marinus, 73 00:07:07.519 --> 00:07:13.663 we will collect and incubate pieces of tissue in specific culture media called 74 00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:14.687 FTM. 75 00:07:15.455 --> 00:07:19.807 Let's collect a small piece of mantle, close to the labial palps. 76 00:07:21.855 --> 00:07:27.999 This area is particularly important, because pseudofeces containing pathogen cells accumulate 77 00:07:28.255 --> 00:07:34.399 there before being rejected in the environment. Perkinsus cells use this advantage 78 00:07:34.655 --> 00:07:36.191 to penetrate oyster tissue. 79 00:07:37.215 --> 00:07:41.567 The small piece is then placed in the tube containing FTM. 80 00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:50.783 Perkinsus cells can also accumulate at the end of the rectum, so let's dissect a little piece 81 00:07:51.039 --> 00:07:51.551 as well. 82 00:08:08.959 --> 00:08:12.543 Perkinsus marinus needs lipids to enlarge. 83 00:08:29.439 --> 00:08:35.583 To avoid the proliferation of bacteria and fungus, we will add antibiotics and 84 00:08:35.839 --> 00:08:37.119 antifungus to the medium. 85 00:08:38.399 --> 00:08:44.543 Tubes will then be stored for one week in the dark at room temperature. 86 00:08:55.039 --> 00:08:58.111 To conclude on health diagnostic, 87 00:08:58.367 --> 00:09:00.671 we will realize a cross section 88 00:09:00.927 --> 00:09:01.951 of the animal. 89 00:09:02.719 --> 00:09:08.863 After sectioning the adductor muscle and removing the oyster from its shell, we will use a scalpel 90 00:09:09.119 --> 00:09:12.703 to cut a fine slide of the digestive gland. 91 00:09:12.959 --> 00:09:17.055 Let's make sure we also include the mantle and gills. 92 00:09:20.639 --> 00:09:26.783 Now we can take the whole section and place it into a histology cassette, that will be placed in 93 00:09:27.039 --> 00:09:28.319 formalin to be fixed, 94 00:09:28.575 --> 00:09:34.719 then alcohol, before being embedded in paraffin, and cut into very fine sections, for further 95 00:09:34.975 --> 00:09:41.119 microscopic observation. 96 00:09:48.543 --> 00:09:52.895 This concludes our oyster dissection and health diagnostic.
